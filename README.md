## What I Learned

Throughout these projects, I learned and applied a variety of programming concepts, including:

- Basic Python syntax and structure
- Data types, loops, and conditionals
- File I/O operations
- Web scraping and API interaction
- Data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Debugging and error handling

Each project provided practical experience with these concepts, reinforcing my understanding and helping me develop as a programmer.
